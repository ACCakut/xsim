HISTORY:

 v0.0   2017/02/09 - start with coding the first ideas
 v0.1   2017/03/19 - first draft which actually seems to do everything as
                     planned
 v0.2   2017/03/21 - bugfix in the verbwrite module
                   - add `use!' and `print!' properties
                   - add the concepts of `noupdate' and `boolean' properties
 v0.4   2017/03/24 - \IfExerciseBooleanPropertyTF
                   - \GetExercisePropertyTF, \PropertyValue
                   - \printallsolutions
                   - \UseExerciseTemplate
                   - bug fix in solution environments: now get printed again
                     when option `print=true' is used
                   - bug fix to the translations of the solution list headings:
                     exercise name instead of exercise type is now printed
                   - \AddtoExerciseTypeGoal, \AddtoExerciseGoal
                     \AddtoExerciseTypeGoalPrint, \AddtoExerciseGoalPrint,
                     \ExerciseGoalValuePrint
                   - \addpoints, \addbonus, \points, \printgoal
 v0.5   2017/03/30 - add style file mechanism
                   - make solution print conditions `section' and `chapter'
                     combinable
 v0.5a  2017/04/15 - fix wrong translation of the `default-heading'
 v0.5b  2017/04/16 - add \SetExerciseProperty
 v0.6   2017/04/27 - official interface for grade distributions
                   - refine hook management (environment module)
 v0.6a  2017/04/28 - refine \blank command, add documentation for said command
 v0.7   2017/05/09 - \xsim_list_length:n
                   - new boolean property `used'
                   - when an exercise is collected the counter isn't stepped
                     but only when the exercise is inserted for the first
                     time; when this happens the new property `used' is set to
                     `true' 
                   - make setting boolean properties case insensitive
                   - add missing pieces to manual (eg `page' property...)
                   - \TotalExerciseGoals and \TotalExerciseTypeGoals
                   - \XSIMifchapterTF
                   - \xsim_if_goal_sum:nnnTF and friends,
                     \IfExerciseTypeGoalsSumTF and \IfExerciseGoalsSumTF
                   - some more hints in the manual regarding collections

                   - random exercise lists from collections
                   - \xsim_collection_count:n
                   - \GetExerciseIdForProperty and \GetExerciseTypeForProperty
                     for unique properties
                   - set property `print=false' during collection and only to
                     true when the corresponding exercises actually are
                     printed
                   - do not insert \par at the beginning and end of exercises
                     and solutions; this should be left to the templates!
                   - new option `print-collection/print' which allows to
                     choose between exercises, solutions, and both to be
                     printed
                   - new parameter `solution-counter' in order to avoid
                     possible conflicts with existing counters

                     the manual
                   - add style file `layouts' which at the moment provides the
                     two exercise templates `runin' and `margin'

                   - only set \ExerciseID and \ExerciseType locally to ensure

                     * changes the behaviour of \collectexercises but doesn't
                       require external files any more and more importantly
                       doesn't require inputting files several times for
                       multiple collections
                     * drop \collectexercisestype

                     and \l__xsim_file_path_tl public
                   - introduce \XSIMsetfilebeginX and \XSIMsetfileendX (xsimverb)
                   - reduce comment line in automated comments in exercise and
                     solution files
                   - add option <tag>/use-unmatched
                   - document option `blank/fill'
                   - add counter foreach type and collection that holds the
                     number of exercises of a type in a collection
                   - fix issue #90
                   - correct file hooks
                   - implement issue #88
                   - fix issue #96
                   - `use!' and `print!' had gone lost. Add them back in.
                   - add new options `match-all'/`match-any' for the collection
                     conditions.  Resolves issue #94.
                   - new \ForEachUsedExerciseByOrder, used in the table
                     templates which resolves issue #85
